## 📘 Overview

This repository contains a collection of lab assignments and implementations for **COE428 – Data Structures and Algorithms**. The course emphasizes the design, implementation, and analysis of fundamental data structures and algorithms using a high-level object-oriented programming language (C++ or Java).

Projects span multiple algorithmic techniques, data abstraction principles, and system-oriented implementations, integrating both theoretical concepts and applied problem-solving.
